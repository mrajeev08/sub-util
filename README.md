Sub 
================

## Usage

This is a bash command line tool for submitting jobs via slurm to remote and pulling
down the results when itâ€™s finished.

For help and usage info, enter `sub -h` on the command line:
```
usage: sub [-h] [-g] [-sn] [-t] [-n] [-mem] [-sp] [-jn] [-wt] [-@] [-st] [-sf]
           [--pulldown] [-md] [--dry] [--heavy] [-ar] [-cmd]

Utility for submitting jobs (in this case an R script) to remote cluster. This
uses an rsync to sync from the local directory to the remote directory. You
will need to create an Rsync script with 'subrsync' in it's name that has
three commented lines of the format: '## user:={username}' (specifies
username); '## cluster:={cluster}' (specifies cluster); and '## dirput:={dir}'
(specifies where to put all your shell & slurm scripts). In each Rscript you
want to run, you can either pass the directories you want to sync from
(syncfrom) from and sync to (syncto) as command line arguments or you can
include them in the script itself. An example is included in this directory.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -g, --gpu            Pass this to write the line requesting GPU nodes
  -sn, --single        Pass this for running job on single node. Defaults to
                       using RMPI and multiple nodes.
  -t , --time          Number of hours to run
  -n , --ntasks        Number of tasks across all nodes
  -mem , --memCPU      Megabyte of memory per CPU
  -sp , --scriptPath   Name of R script
  -jn , --jobName      Name of job/slurm script
  -wt , --wait         time interval to check if job complete
  -@, --email          Pass this argument if you want an email when the job
                       starts and ends
  -st , --syncto       Directory to pull TO, if NULL will look in Rscript
                       passed for syncto
  -sf , --syncfrom     Remote directory to pull FROM, if NULL will look in
                       Rscript passed for syncfrom
  --pulldown           Pass this arg if you just want to pull down the results
                       from the script either using the syncfrom/to tags in
                       the script or the cmd line args (see -sf and -st)
  -md , --modules      Other modules to load in slurm script, should be passed
                       as string of module names separated by a space and in
                       quotes
  --dry                If you just want to create the shell scripts/see what
                       commands will be run without running them pass this.
  --heavy              To minimize node fracturing (i.e. if you have a job
                       that requires more than 4 GB per core). Uses up to 12
                       cores per node so that even smallest nodes on della are
                       available.
  -ar , --array        Pass an array to an array job (a string in quotes),
                       i.e. -ar '0-2'
  -cmd , --cmdargs     Pass command line arguments to pass to the script (a
                       string in quotes), i.e. -cmd '10 TRUE'
```

## Setting-up

For MacOS & terminal:

1. Add the following line to your `.bash_profile` file.
```
if [ -r ~/.bashrc ]; then
   source ~/.bashrc
fi
```
2. Add the following line to your `.bashrc` file.
```
export PATH=$PATH:{path/to/subutil}
```

Also you may need to make the sub file executable first, run this line in terminal from the directory the file is in: ```chmod u+x sub```

You will also need to VPN in to della (even if you are on a campus connection) so that you don't have to duo each time and you will need to [set up an sshkey](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/removing_tedium/tree/master/02_passwordless_logins).

## Example

In the [example](example/) folder, you will find a test case you can run.

First, download or clone the directory to your local computer. 
```
git clone https://github.com/mrajeev08/subutil.git
```

Change the rsync paths & username as to yours and then open terminal and try:
```
sub -sn -t 1 -n 1 -sp "example/test.R" -jn "test" -wt 20s
```

I use the R package [`here`](https://here.r-lib.org) to manage the nested directory paths, although its not super necessary.  

## Hat tip 

Thanks to this really useful worksop [on removing tedium from your research workflow](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/removing_tedium) and [@jdh4](https://github.com/jdh4) for the inspiration and bash help session, and also to [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net), a very useful tool for checking your scripts.

Dependencies:
- R (version 3.6.0 or higher)
- [argparser](https://github.com/trevorld/r-argparse) package which requires python 

## To Do
- [ ] Switch to [docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.R) for fewer dependencies & cleaner code?
